#Would you rather?

This app is the second major project within the Udacity React Nanodegree. It provides users with a fun way to interact by asking silly hypothetical questions in the format, Would You Rather? Answers are presented as two options. Users can create new questions and vote on their preferred responses. The project uses React with hooks and Redux, and various other packages.

##Instructions

###To run the project:
You'll need a dev environment set up, with all the usual suspects - Node, etc.

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.

2. Run npm install

3. Run npm start

###To play would you rather:

As at the current version, I've built a mock log-in flow. I may build this out in future, if there's any value in doing so.

Simply login, navigate around the app, answer questions, and create your own if desired.
