# Askr

This app is based on the second major project within the Udacity React Nanodegree. It provides users with a fun way to interact by asking hypothetical questions in the format, Would You Rather? Answers are presented as two options. Users can create new questions and vote on their preferred responses. The project uses React with hooks, Redux, React Router and various other packages.

## Instructions

### To run the project:
You'll need a dev environment, with all the usual suspects installed - Node, etc.

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.

2. Run npm install

3. Run npm start

### To play Askr:

As at the current version, I've built a mock log-in flow. I may build this out in future, if there's any value in doing so.

Simply login, navigate around the app, answer questions, and create your own if desired.
